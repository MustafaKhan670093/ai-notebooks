# The AI Notebooks

AI research does not occur in a vaccum. It occurs as a result of people responding to, criticising, and being inspired by the work being done before and around them. Here I present key ideas in AI in the historical order in which they occured. I'm no historian so this is my comic book rendering of AI history and the papers I discuss and implement are limited to those I know about.
