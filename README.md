# The AI Notebooks

AI research does not occur in a vaccum. It occurs as a result of people responding to, criticising, and being inspired by the work being done before and around them at any given moment. Here I present key ideas in AI in the historical order in which they occured. To do so we'll work with the papers (where the ideas were presented) and implement code (where the ideas are actualized).
